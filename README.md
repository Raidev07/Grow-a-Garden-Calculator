# Fruit Mutation Compute Price

## Description
This project is a simple web-based tool that allows users to select a fruit and apply various mutations to compute the final price in Sheckles. The tool uses a predefined dataset of fruits with their base prices and mutation multipliers to calculate the mutated price.

## How It Works
- Type or select a fruit from the input field with autocomplete suggestions.
- Select one or more mutations (if available) using the displayed checkboxes.
- Click the "Compute Price" button to calculate and display the final mutated price.
- The price is calculated by multiplying the base price of the fruit by the product of all selected mutation multipliers.

## Fruit Data
The fruit data includes a variety of fruits with their base prices in Sheckles. Each fruit has a set of mutation multipliers that affect the final price when applied. These multipliers are defined in the JavaScript logic and are used to compute the mutated price.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the input field to type or select a fruit from the autocomplete list.
3. Select mutations if available by checking the corresponding boxes.
4. Click "Compute Price" to see the result displayed below the form.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the UI, including the fruit input with datalist and mutation checkboxes.
- `styles.css`: Stylesheet for the UI.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the fruit data, mutation multipliers, and logic for fruit selection, mutation computation, and result display.
