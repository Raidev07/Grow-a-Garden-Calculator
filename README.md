# Fruit Mutation Compute Price

## Description
This project is a simple web-based tool that allows users to select a fruit and apply various mutations to compute the final price in Sheckles. The tool uses a predefined dataset of fruits with their base prices and mutation multipliers to calculate the mutated price.

## How It Works
- Select a fruit from the dropdown list.
- Select one or more mutations (if available) to apply to the fruit.
- Click the "Compute Price" button to calculate and display the final mutated price.
- The price is calculated by multiplying the base price of the fruit by the product of all selected mutation multipliers.

## Fruit Data
The fruit data includes a variety of fruits with their base prices in Sheckles. Some fruits have price ranges, which are averaged for computation. Mutation multipliers are currently empty but can be extended to include various mutation effects.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the dropdown to select a fruit.
3. Select mutations if available.
4. Click "Compute Price" to see the result.
